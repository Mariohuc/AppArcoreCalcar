# APP WITH ARCORE TO VISUALIZE MATHEMATICAL SURFACES
## Thesis project
In this project, I use Unity and ARCORE. I'm making graph throught the Instantiate method to create several cubes.

## Setting
- Unity 2018.2.X

## Demostration

A first sample is an ellipsoid, chosen by the user which has been modified in its parameters "a", "b" and "c" that have default values, Each parameter mentioned corresponds to the blue buttons, which are the Semi-axis [a], Semi-axis [b] and Semi-axis [c] respectively, and each one can be modified using the slider.

In another sample there is a hyperboloid of a leaf, previously chosen by the user which has been modified in its parameters Skirt radius “a” whose current value is 1.487572 (as the slider moves the value changes to “a”) and the radius "c".

By changing any parameter of a certain figure through the slider, it will look like it changes shape in real time.
